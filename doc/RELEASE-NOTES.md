# Retz release notes

## 0.3.1

* Make Tomcat thread pool metrics available via JMX.
* Add default JVM options to each commands; "-Xms8m -XX:+UseSerialGC" to
 'retz-client' and 'retz-admin'.
* Fix downloading binary file more than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` size.
* Change default planner from `naive` to `fifo`. `naive` and `priority` planner
  are deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Use `fifo` or `priority2`
  instead.

## 0.3.0

* Remove support of Mesos 1.0 and 1.1 (see MESOS-6625) 
* Add version check when registered to Mesos. Currently 1.2 and 1.3 are supported.
  If Retz is registered to Mesos master of unsupported version, it aborts.

## 0.2.11 (abandoned)

* Fix unnecessary 'null' being appended to result of 'get-file' and 'list-files'
  in response from Mesos.
* Add 3-times retry when Mesos' HTTP response was wrong and HttpURLConnection
  failed to parse as HTTP response, or when the TCP connection unexpectedly
  closed.
* Fix wrong JSON parsing in response of `/state` API of agents, which
  used to result in Job#url often being 'null' and forever null, preventing
  'get-file' from clients. But this is just a workaround as those API
  calls can be replaced with deterministic URL construction involving
  Job data structure change, which requires incompatible protocol change.

## 0.2.10

** This is the last version that works with Mesos 1.1 and older.**

* Change default behaviour of empty `retz.mesos.role` configuration.
  When it is empty Retz now registers as empty role framework without
  `MULTI_ROLE` capabilty, which was previously using principle name as
  role name. If a role name is specified Retz automatically registers
  as `MULTI_ROLE` capable framework (but internally Retz does not
  handle multiple roles).
* Add `retz.mesos.failover.timeout` to set failover timeout
* Fix bug in Resource#cut which was not actually cutting
  resource
* Fix NaivePlanner was not taking disk resources into account (#165)
* Support standard format of Mesos master discovery address
  e.g. `zk://zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181/mesos` - with this
  now Retz survives Mesos master change and restart (#140, #141)
* Fix binary download failure on files that include `+` in
  their names (#161)
* Error log message cleanup

## 0.2.9

* Fix failing `uploadArtifact` by replacing aws-maven with
  maven-publish plugin. Due to this issue 0.2.8 is abandoned.

## 0.2.8 (abandoned release)

* Update almost all dependencies
* On fetching files from job sandbox, now servers return 404
  when requested files do not exist.
* Read command from standard input at Client CLI

## 0.2.7

* Fix double-counting-offers bug when an agent got lost (#153)
* Improve error handling, server side IOException returns to
  clients as 500, which used to be 404.
* Mask secret strings on server side logging.
* Download from Agents' sandbox is fully sent in streaming
  manner, both in clients and servers.
* Move CI from Wercker to CircleCI.
* Add 'application/json' content type to response of /kill API.

## 0.2.6

* Fix a bug where kill is never sent to Mesos while state in Retz
  is updated to 'KILLED'. This was introduced at `0f8dcf5f` and
  resident since 0.2.2.

## 0.2.5

* Client and Planner SPI is now available via Maven repository.
* [Experimental] Add several new builtin planners under new planner
  SPI, "fifo" and "priority2". These are mostly copy of "naive" and
  "priority" respectively.
* [Experimental] Add 'retz.classpath' to load third-party planner
  dynamically on startup. Retz server tries to load all jar files
  recursively placed under that directory. See `io.github.retz.planner.spi.Planner`
  for more on creating custom planner. To use custom planner, set
  full class name with package name to 'retz.planner.name'.

## 0.2.4

* Fix client-side polling interval increase logic on 'run', where 5th
  increase exceeds the limit.
* Select query on listing jobs were using 'ASC' in job id order but
  should be descending order to list latest ones.

## 0.2.3

* Sort tags in 'list' result
* Any value in '--states' option is ignored when '--state' is specified

## 0.2.2

* Add `ALL` syntax sugar representing all states of job, to 'list'.
* Change `Client#getBinaryFile()` input argument from output path to
  output stream to hide unnecessary binary copy.
* Add an option to give multiple states of job to fetch from server
  to list command of CLI. State names separated commas for '--states'
  option makes client to fetch jobs of each state. Note that those
  jobs are not consistent, which may lack or include jobs stale state
  as CLI client just repeats fetching for each state.
* Introduce server side limit on listing jobs, by default up to
  65536 jobs, configurable with `retz.max.list-jobs` item in server
  configuration.
* Fix a bug that it was possible to kill a finished job.
* Make Retz scheduling disk space aware. '--disk' is now added to
  'schedule' and 'run' to CLI as well as `disk` is added to some
  constructors of class Job. Note that although this change involves
  client library interface, no protocol is changed.

## 0.2.1

* Fix '--binary' mode failing downlaod of 'get-files' in case of
 'retz.tls.insecure=true'. This was because Retz clients on binary
  download strictly checking certificates provided by a server.
* Add '--timeout' option to 'run' and 'get-file'. After the timeout
  the job will be killed by the client. This is end-to-end timeout
  that includes job waiting period in the queue.
* Fix a bug where a user may kill other users' jobs once their IDs
  are known.
* 'kill' now returns 404 when killing non-existing job is requested. (#104)
* Fix a bug in binary file download where downloading file under
  directory deeper than just in a sandbox fails, when same relative
  path directory does not exist. Instead Retz just directory create
  a file under the destination directory.

## 0.2.0

This is an incompatible release with 0.1.4. While 0.1.4 and 0.2.0
have same database DDL, they are different in JSON. Users may or
may not access to old jobs and applications. A recommended way of
upgrade, on Postgres is to dump only `users` table, and remove all
entries in `jobs` and `applications` table followed by restore of
`users` table.

* Fix a severe bug that a binary file downloaded from sandbox via
  `/job/<id>/file` is broken. This is because Retz had been
  fetching files from `/files/read` endpoint of Mesos where a file
  content is provided via JSON. A new Retz HTTP endpoint `/job/<id>/download`
  has been added to the client, with '--binary' option to 'get-file'
  CLI subcommand. (#118)
* Fix '-E' '--env' option of 'schedule' subcommand (#110)
* Remove 'persistentFiles' and 'diskMB' from `protocol.data.Application`
  This is incompatible change to the client-server protocol and
  client library interface.
* Add '--tag' and '--state' option to 'list' and add 'killall' subcommand .
  This involves API change of client library and protocol change,
  especially `ListJobRequest` changed to 'POST' request.
* Add a set of String 'tags' to `Job` class, to selectively list jobs by a tag.
* Change `protocol.data.Job` class, having `ResourceQuantity` as member `resources`.
  This introduces incompatible change between 0.1 and 0.2, too.
* Add server version and protocol version to every requests and response.
  This makes all communication between 0.1 and 0.2 incompatible.
* Fix a bug where 'retz-admin gc' fails on PostgreSQL (#112)
* Clean up response of '/status' and cache all data not to trigger query
  to database all the time. This is incompatible change limited to the
  form of `/status` response (`StatusResponse` class).

## 0.1.4

* Make 'enable-user' and 'disable-user' live, adding implementation to
  existing mock.
* Fix a bug where retz-admin 'create-user' fails. This bug has been
  resident since 0.1.2.
* Fix a bug where retz-admin fails with NullPointerException when no
  configuration file found by setting default file '/opt/retz-server/etc/retz.properties'
  to share JMX port configuration with server

## 0.1.3

* Change default Unix user name on task execution to 'nobody', secondly
  'retz.user' in configuration, as well as prohibiting 'root'. It is
  used to initialize framework and remote Unix user.
* Fix a bug: when restarting Retz, if tables for Retz (user, jobs, etc.)
  still remain in PostgreSQL Retz fails to check table existence and
  cannot start.
* Fix 'list-files' showing 500 error but showing other proper errors (#101)

## 0.1.2

* Fix a severe bug where users may see or use others' applications
  jobs (#103).
* Change client options to standard conventions e.g. [GNU Coding Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command_002dLine-Interfaces.html).
* Add '-v' and '--verbose' option to client CLI.
* Fix a bug where System.out was closed and no error message is printed
  when no file is found in sandbox on 'get-file'. (#80)
* Add original User-Agent header line to HTTP request of retz-client.
* Update Sparkjava to 2.5.3 from 2.3.
* Add server version checker to client - just warns when version
  mistmatch found in major and minor version numbers.
* Change CLI output of retz-admin and retz-client to print out to System.out
  from System.err. Thread name and class name are also removed from every line.
* Fix and change 'retz-admin usage' command which was not working, to
  return **all** finished jobs within the period regardless of the application
  owner. As a consequence, '-id' option was removed.
* Add '--grace-period' option to 'retz-client load-app' command to set
  grace period before Mesos sends `SIGKILL` . Its allowed range is 0 ~ 1024,
  where 0 means default value of Mesos (it should depend on Mesos version).
  At the same time a new entry in `Application` is added. This change
  breaks backward compatibility, which prevents new clients later
  than this from connecting to old servers ( #100 ).
* Add '--info' option to 'retz-admin' command to annotate each user with
  additional information, such as mail address or any other arbitrary
  string. **This requires database update or reset, adding a column**.
  Also, this introduces incompatibility to a protocol between retz-server
  and retz-admin.

## 0.1.1

* Remove file check right after schedule succeeded on 'run' subcommand.
  Without this, false `FileNotFoundException` could have been throws
  when a client is too fast that starts polling the file before the
  file is created in sandbox.
* Package installers of `retz-client` now recognizes
  ``/opt/retz-client/etc/retz.properties` as configuration file,
  not removing them on package updates.
* Add garbage job history collection, which periodically collects
  (deletes from database)`FINISHED` and `KILLED` jobs that finished
  several periods ago (defined as 'retz.gc.leeway' in seconds). The
  collector is invoked repeatedly with predefined interval (defined
  as 'retz.gc.interval'). This is to prevent job execution history
  occupies the backend data store, in case of H2 database it might
  make JVM garbage collector heavier day by day. The garbage collector
  may also be invoked manually, with admin tool `ret-admin gc`.

## 0.1.0

* Update simplejmx to 1.13, Jackson to 2.8.5, jcommander to 1.58 and
  docker-java to 3.0.6.
* Change server to bind an IP address that is written as 'retz.bind' of
  configuration file (#62).
* Add '-N' (or '--name') option to subcommand 'run' and 'schedule' to
  set plain job name. The default value of job name has also changed
  to String value of hash code of command.
* Add 'retz.mesos.refuse' to control (sort of) interval of resource
  offers from Mesos master, to file configuration of retz-server.
  Default value is 3 seconds.
* Add 'retz.jmx.port' to file configuration of retz-server and retz-admin
  to change port number.

## 0.0.34

* Fix a bug where tasks get `TASK_LOST` when multiple slaves and multiple
  jobs scheduled at once. This is because the scheduler tries to accept
  offers of multiple agents at once.
* Priority planner is added as well as ``-prio`` option to CLI (#26).

## 0.0.33

* Remove 'retz.gpu' from server configuration file. It's replacement
  is 'retz.max.gpus' - setting 0 or a positive integer.
* Introduce a new system limit 'retz.max.cpus', 'retz.max.mem',
  'retz.max.gpus' 'retz.max.ports' and 'retz.max.disk', which limits
  the size of every job when it being scheduled.  Default values are
  8, 31744 MB, 0, 10 and 1024 MB. This is to prevent default FIFO
  behaviour of `NaivePlanner` getting stuck by a single large job in
  the top.
* Make 'Authorization' header "must" so as to identify users of all
  requests as well as add `NoopAuthenticator` to enable free
  authorization mode.  This fixes broken non-authentication mode
  (`retz.authentication = false`, #61).  Non-authentication mode now
  requires `retz.access.key` while secret can be empty.
* Change verb of 'schedule' protocol from `PUT` to `POST` for cleaner
  HTTP API. This introduces incompatible change to client-server
  protocol.
* Fix failures in 'list-files' when '+' included in the path
  (#79). Retz server also requested to Mesos master with
  non-URL-encoded URL and got 404.
* 'get-file' reports if a file is not present (#80)
* `ClientHelper.getWholeFile()` now returns `JobNotFoundException`
  when a job is not found.
* Fix large file size failure on 'list-files' and 'get-file' (#81)
  This introduced incompatible change to client-server communication
  protocol.
* Return 404 when a job is not found on requests (#83)

## 0.0.32

* Avoid Resource.merge in case of counting the amount of ports ( #74 ).
* Fix a bug that date format of output of list-files (#78).
* Package installation of both RPM and DEB does not create 'retz' user
  any more. 'retz' user is to be created by operators depending on its
  setup.  Now package installer also preserves existing
  '/opt/retz-server/etc/retz.properties'.
* Fix a race condition ( #69 ) where Jetty thread and Mesos client
  callback thread both read a job from database and launch task *s*
  with different offers. This causes the job (task) with same task id
  refused by Mesos and the latter returns by "TASK_ERROR".

## 0.0.31

* Fix a bug ( #74) in a cluster where > 2 Mesos agents serving same port range
  causes a crash before accepting offers. This was introduced at 0.0.30
  ( `c1fe39c998fdb433d` ). *This was not actually fixed by this change*

## 0.0.30

* Fix a bug (#38) where files and directories in a directory in the sandbox
  cannot be downloaded or listed. This introduces *incompatible changes*
  to the client-server protocol. Also, options of "list-files" and 'get-file'
  are changed.
* 'localhost', '127.0.0.1' and '0.0.0.0' are officially not allowed as
  a value of 'retz.mesos' in Retz server configuration.
* Add port range allocation which is supported by Mesos - available at
  'run' and 'schedule' subcommand with '-ports' option specifying *amount*
  of ports, which will be provided as environment variables '$PORT0',
  '$PORT1' and so on. All jobs may use up to 1000 ports. This introduces
  *incompatible changes* to JSON formatting over network.
* Split FileConfiguration to client and server configuration, guiding
  more suitable key names and descriptions. Especially, 'retz.bind' at
  client side config is renamed to 'retz.server.uri'.

## 0.0.29

* Fix wrong timestamp representaion in all logs; it should be 0-23 hours
  for a day but it was 0-12 without AM/PM notion.
* Fix a bug where an exceeding job is to be launched with stocked offers,
  with a huge clean up on creating execution plan matching offers and jobs
* Print reason at 'retz-client run' when the job is killed
* Remove Persistent Volumes support

## 0.0.28

* Fix a bug where return value of 'retz-client run' always being non-zero
  (esp. default value of Job.result()). By the way, since 0.0.27, Retz is
  using Mesos' default command executor and thus Retz cannot take return
  value of application command any more. Instead it returns `0` iff the
  task state ends with `TASK_FINISHED`, otherwise `i - TASK_FINISHED` where
  `i` is the last task state.
* Update HTML page '/' removing all WebSocket JavaScript code and replace
  with simple guidance and small update on latest status.
* Remove 'watch' command and protocol. This changed 'ScheduleRequest'
  protocol and introduced incompatibility.
* Add integer priority field to 'Job' object in the protocol for future use.
  This introduces incompatible change to client-server protocol.
* Preserve Framework id in database and reuse it after restart. Mesos
  scheduler failover timeout is now set as 1 week (hard coded). Now
  Retz has at most one week maintenance window without losing any
  information or tasks. After 1 week absent if framework id is
  preserved in database, Mesos will refuse connection from Retz unless
  Retz forgets the framework id. In that case, just removing framework
  id from database (i.e. deleting whole database file, or executing
  `DELETE FROM properties WHERE key='FrameworkID'` at database
  console) will enable Retz connect to Mesos again.
* Add PostgreSQL JDBC driver with configuration items such as
  'retz.database.driver', 'retz.database.user' and
  'retz.database.pass' to support PostgreSQL as backend
  database. Currently it only support database name 'retz'.
* Remove H2 connection pool and use Tomcat JDBC connection pool.

## 0.0.27

* Add '-stderr' option to 'retz-client run' so that job standard error is
  easily printed at the client console, which is off by default.
* Remove RetzExecutor, preserving as local mode executor. Pre-set environment
  variable including `$RETZ_CPU`, `$RETZ_MEM` and `$RETZ_PVNAME` are now
  removed. Instead, reuse arguments of `-cpu`, `-mem` and persistent volume
  name.
* Remove 'unload-app' and add 'enabled' flag to application instead, and
  made application overwritable. In near future, Namely `UnloadApp`
  protocol, 'DELETE /app/<appid>' will be deprecated and removed. Also,
  this introduces in incompatible change to client-server protocol.
* Add administration CLI tool 'retz-admin' as a new subproject, with JMX
  ports opening at startup. With 'retz-admin', many features like creating,
  disabling and getting information of users get available via JMX local
  port. It will be released as another release package as well as
  'retz-server' and 'retz-client'. 
* Remove logback from client to avoid initialization overhead
* Change default value of 'retz.max.running' from 512 to 128
* Add Docker volume mount option and protocol. By adding 
  `--docker-volumes Vol1,Vol2,..` to 'load-app', subcommand on Docker
  container, jobs on all those applications will be with those volumes
  mounted inside Docker containers. Besides, Docker volume driver process
  must be running all Mesos Agent nodes.
* Add shutdown hook to gracefully and safely stop database
* Add resource offer stocking with limit `retz.max.stock` in configuration.
  With offers stocked in scheduler and job queue empty, a new job schedule
  or run request do not need to wait for resource offer - task will be
  invoked during the schedule request. Scheduler may stock up to `retz.max.stock`
  (default 16) offers. To disable stocking, set it 0. Hit `/status` API to
  see current status of offers.
* Remove Range from CUI and protocol
* Major clean up moving from on-memory data structure utilizing java.util.concurrent
  to data structure based on relational model and transactions using JDBC.
  Currently primary database is H2 Database - on moving to other database
  it will require change on connection pooling.

## 0.0.26

* Add 'retz.exectutor.java' to server configuration file for more flexible
  Java installation on Mesos Agents. `TASK_FAILED` and log `Message from
  Mesos executor: Executor terminated:REASON_EXECUTOR_TERMINATED` in Retz
  server may indicate correct Java could not be found.
* Add 'retz.max.running' to server configuration file. This number limits
  number of simultaneously running jobs, to control Retz load to whole
  Mesos cluster.
* Add 'Server:' header into response from Server to know right version
  of client to use.
* Implement framework authentication by adding 'retz.mesos.secret.file'
  to server configuration file. This file gives Retz a creditial to
  connect Mesos master.

## 0.0.25

* Add '-U' and '--user' option to 'load-app' to change user name in
  executor; sometimes it is convenient to run as root. Besides, it is
  not allowed to be root in RetzExecutor.
* Move from WebSocket to HTTP polling at 'run' subcommand.
* Add 'get-file' and 'list-files' subcommand.
* Simplify 'get-job' as to get summary of a job; getting stdout and stderr
  is moved to 'get-file'.
* Remove '-R' option from 'run' subcommand, instead it prints stdout of
  a remote job to local standard output. This is based on polling, as it
  may be replaces with combination of 'schedule' and 'get-file' with '--poll'
  option. Currently, polling interval starts with 1 second and increases
  up to 32 seconds unless any update comes up. Any update will reset the
  interval to initial interval.
* Remove direct communication between clients and Mesos servers, which is
  now relayed by Retz server with `GetFileRequest` and `ListFilesRequest`
  protocol - now Retz clients only talks with Retz server via single
  HTTP(S) route.
* Updates from Mesos master on Task status are more up to date on states
  managed inside Retz server - which still does not have complete
  correspondence.
* Simple client-server authentication support: only for single user.
  As a special exception, commands that use WebSocket connection does
  not require authentication (it just does not work). Authentication is
  enabled by default. To secure application usage, Set your own pair of
  `retz.access.key` and `retz.access.secret`, which accepts arbitrary ASCII
  string. To disable authentication, in both client and server, just
  explicitly set `retz.authentication = false`. 
* Remove too strong message at client on accessing server with HTTP.

## 0.0.24

* Add TLS to connection between client and server. Make sure that the
  server is using valid certificate, or Mesos fetcher cannot fetch
  RetzExecutor jar file and no job cannot be run. In that case only
  Docker executor may work (use `--container docker` to load application).
  (Note: when TLS enabled 'run' and 'watch' does not work well as it is
  still using 'ws://' protocol)
* Change type of `-gpu` argument of CLI from range to integer
* Replace Docker containerizer with unified containerizer using Docker:
  this changes Mesos Agent setup requirement as to add
  `--image_providers=docker` and
  `--isolation=docker/runtime,filesystem/linux` in addition to existing
  configuration. See Mesos document [on containers](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/docs/container-image.md)
  and [on GPU with Docker](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/docs/gpu-support.md#minimal-setup-with-support-for-docker-containers)

## 0.0.23

## 0.0.19

* Add retry in case of task got LOST
* Add new '-L' option on `load-app`: '-F' used to require agents to cache
  files, but it is replaced by '-L' ('--large-file'), and '-F' is for
  files that shouldn't be cached (like program files for try-'n-error!)
