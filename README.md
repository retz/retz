# Retz [![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/8aa503883d1a504ebd34ae72b9ac9dfd/s/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/byKey/8aa503883d1a504ebd34ae72b9ac9dfd)

Retz is a simple job queuing and execution service which runs on top
of [Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org) as a framework.

## Getting Started

Retz needs JDK8 to build.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/retz/retz
$ cd retz
$ make deb
```

or run `make rpm` for RPM-managed environment like Red Hat, Fedora,
CentOS Linux.

Retz requires Mesos ( >= 1.0) running (see
[staring Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/gettingstarted/) ),
optionally libnuma for its runtime. To check Mesos version,
run `mesos-master --version`.

Install the server:

```
# sudo dpkg -i retz-server-x.y.z.deb
```

Edit `/opt/retz-server/etc/retz.properties` according to your environment:

* `retz.mesos = 192.168.100.128:5050` - A pair of IP address and port
  number where Mesos master is listening to. Thus Mesos master must be
  running
* `retz.bind = http://localhost:9090` - An URL of host name and port
  number where Retz will bind and start Web server (port number must
  be > 1024)
* `retz.mesos.principal = retz` - Mesos principal name
* `retz.mesos.role = retz` - Role name in Mesos

Retz is a program that runs just in foreground. To start Retz in
console, type

```
# /opt/retz-server/bin/retz-server
```

And you can find Retz server started up by opening
[the web console](http://localhost:9090). If you want Retz server
daemonized, use external daemonization system like supervisord.

Or to run without installation, just run

```
$ bin/retz-server
```

in your repository.

To run basic test, follow this with `/opt/retz-client/bin` in your
`$PATH` environment variable and edit
`/opt/retz-client/etc/retz.properties` as well as server. To test your
Retz setup, run

```
$ retz-client load-app -A test
$ retz-client run -A test -cmd 'uname -a'
```

and you'll have result of `uname -a` in some arbitrary Mesos Agent
node.

## Kick a job with resources allocated via Retz Mesos framework

Make your application loaded on Retz:

```
$ retz-client load-app -A your-app-name -F http://example.com/path/to/your/application.tar.gz
```

With `-F` option, any type of files is automatically downloaded by
mesos and the file is cached in the Agent node. In addition to `http`,
`hdfs` is also available. With subcommand `retz-client list-app`
you'll see your application is registered to Retz. To run a job via
Retz scheduler:

```
$ retz-client run -A your-app-name -cmd 'relative/path/to/your/bin/cmd -some-args' -R -
```

where `cmd` is included in your application tar ball. Then you'll get
results printed at standard output of your console. The result is also
available via Mesos sandbox UI. `run` is a synchronous execution
subcommand while `schedule` is an asynchronous execution subcommand.
